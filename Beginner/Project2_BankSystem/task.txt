SIMPLE AUTHENTICATION AND SUBTRACTION
Write a program that simulates a basic login and performs a subtraction operation if the login is successful.

Prompt the user to enter an email and password.
If both match the predefined values (email="mkee@gamil.com" and password=12345),
 allow the user to enter a number to subtract from x=1000.
If the email or password is incorrect, display an error message.
