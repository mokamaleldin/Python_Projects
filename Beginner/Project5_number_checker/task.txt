### USER CHOICE

Write a function that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a number between 0 and 10.

If the input is not a digit, display a message indicating it's not valid and prompt again.
If the input is a digit but outside the acceptable range (0-10), inform the user and prompt again.
If the input is a valid digit within the range, accept it and print the chosen number.

EX:
Input: Please enter a number (0-10): 15
Output: Sorry, you are out of acceptable range (0-10)

Input: Please enter a number (0-10): Hello
Output: Sorry that is not a digit!

Input: Please enter a number (0-10): 5
Output: 5
